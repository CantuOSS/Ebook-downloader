EBOOK DOWNLOADER

This is a java project made for educational purposes, it basically parses an HTML document
and looks for a certain download link, then proceeds to get the file associated
with it.

The files are fetched from the site it-ebooks.info.

This project is made to test java's networking tols.

Please don't make abusive use of this tool, otherwise i'll remove it.

Usage: you specify the starting book id from it-ebooks's naming convention, "Example: http://it-ebooks.info/book/XYZ/"
where XYZ is the number of the book, this allows to loop for various books and
to test the efficency of this tool.

The ideal usages for this tool are for learning how to parse HTML files, and how to get
or download files with HTTP requests.

TODO list:
*	Document source code
*	Add don't abuse warning message
*	List libraries used
*	Add requesting for HTML response code before attempting anything else
*	Polish UI
*	Add usage to menu bar
